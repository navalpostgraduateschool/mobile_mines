# Developer Notes: Updates to MATLAB Mobile Mines

## Summary of Changes

1. **Import and Export Buttons for Minefield (JSON)**:
   - Added buttons to import and export the minefield configuration in JSON format. This allows users to save and load minefield setups for reuse across simulations.

2. **Minefield Distribution Updates**:
   - Removed the old minefield distribution methods and introduced three new methods for mine placement:
     - **Random Uniform**: Randomly places mines uniformly across the grid.
     - **Random Gaussian**: Places mines following a Gaussian distribution centered on the grid.
     - **Uniform with Error**: Evenly distributes mines, but with added Gaussian error (standard deviation is inversely proportional to the number of mines).
   
3. **Focus on App GUI After Import/Export**:
   - Ensured that the app GUI regains focus after importing or exporting a minefield configuration. This improves the user experience by making the app responsive after these operations.

4. **Standardization of Button Sizes & Limitation on Max Mines**:
   - Standardized the size of the import and export buttons for a consistent and polished look across the app interface.
   - Limited the maximum number of mines to **10,000** to avoid performance issues and maintain usability within the simulation.

5. **UUV Path Correction**:
   - Fixed the Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) path to the correct endpoint, addressing the issue where the UUV path was not correctly leading to the designated destination.

6. **Mine Explosion Behavior**:
   - Corrected the behavior of mine explosions, ensuring they now trigger properly when a UUV enters their blast radius, providing more realistic and consistent simulation results.

7. **Logo Creation & Compilation**:
   - Created a new logo for the app to give it a more professional and recognizable visual identity.
   - Completed the app compilation for final deployment.

## Additional Changes

- **GUI and Visual Improvements**:
  - Updated the appearance and layout of buttons and components to ensure better user interaction and overall aesthetic appeal.

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Enhanced the simulationâ€™s performance by limiting the number of mines and ensuring that the random distribution methods are computationally efficient.

## Known Issues

- **Import/Export File Compatibility**: Ensure that the exported JSON file is correctly formatted and matches the expected structure, or else errors may occur when importing the file back into the app.
- **Simulation Speed with High Mine Counts**: While the limit on the number of mines has been set to 10,000, large-scale simulations may still experience slower performance due to the processing load.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Minefield Configurations**: Consider adding additional mine distribution algorithms or user-defined configurations for more flexibility.
- **Fleet Behavior Tweaks**: Improve the fleet behavior logic to support more dynamic strategies.
- **Simulation Speed**: Continue to optimize for large-scale simulations with thousands of UUVs and mines.

## Version History

- **Version 1.1**: Added import/export buttons, fixed UUV path and mine explosion issues.
- **Version 1.0**: Initial release.
